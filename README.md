# face-api-verifier
Uses MS FaceAPI to verify user photos against a dummy library of user photos

The dummy library is a simple map stored in the Service layer, using sample images found online. This can be replaced by any image library of choice.

To use, the `[subscription key]` also needs replacing with a valid key, and the `BASE_URL` variable needs a valid location based on the key.
